        Select the project you will translate to the web for Assignment 1. <br> <br>
        The project should be one that will sustain your interest for the next several weeks, but need not be your "best" or most recent work. <br>
        Consider:
        <ul>
            <li>The quantity and variety of available material. Is there a range of media types, drawings, diagrams, animations, research?</li>
            <li>Does the project have a clear critical or conceptual core that will be creatively generative in this new format?</li>
            <li>Does the project have an intrinsic relationship to technology or digital media that might inform the concept of your website?</li>
            <li>Was your project somehow limited by its original presentation format?</li>
        </ul>
        Once you've chosen your project:
        <ul>
            <li>"Pin it up" on <a href="https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/MDZJNnhHRmZCdVY0TGJwUExFNjFLYWVReWZzbnA0c0VLMTY0WTV3TkhKK0FBcGw2Z0hENExCOXBwMGlZcnNGMklNTVJqd0p1c3dUY1J1MTdMVFBzcXBYZEVwaE9RZHZyMDJ2UURvT3JYL2c4aWJoZHF2ZUsrQzlRZmMvdy9NdnJhWWluRVAxeXRuUUgwWDl3Mk1qRGVRPT0hdjE=?share_link_id=616425660275">this Miro board.</a></li>
            <li>Create a slideshow (if you don't already have one) and place a link or PDF on the Miro board as well.</li>
        </ul>
        As your revisit the project, consider the implications of these two formats.
        <ul>
        <li>How is the 2D space of the Miro board different from from the linear progression of the slideshow?</li>
        <li>How does the virtual space of the Miro board differ from the physical space of the wall?</li>
        </ul>
        Each student will briefly introduce themselves and their projects during next week's class, following the lecture and demos.
