          Miro board</a> from last week, rearrange your project into a first-draft mockup of a website. How many pages are there, how do you move between them? How are images, text and other media organized? </p>

          <p>If you didn't present your project last week, prepare to do so for this class using your updated Miro layout.</p>

          <p>In VS Code, begin building the website for your project. See how close you can get to your mockup from the Miro board. </p>

          <p>**A recap of the demo from last week will be posted here shortly.** In the meantime, some resources for getting introduced to HTML and CSS are included above. Browse through them to see which one more suits your learning style, or feel free to seek out your own.</p>

    Choose a project to translate to the web for Assignment 1. Some things to
    consider:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The quantity and variety of available material. Is there a range of
        media types, drawings, diagrams, animations, research?
      </li>
      <li>
        Does the project have a clear critical or conceptual core that will be
        creatively generative in this new format?
      </li>
      <li>
        Does the project have an intrinsic relationship to technology or
        digital media that might inform the concept of your website?
      </li>
      <li>
        Was your project somehow limited by its original presentation format?
      </li>
    </ul>
    Once you've chosen your project:
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Pin it up" on
        <a
          href="https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/MDZJNnhHRmZCdVY0TGJwUExFNjFLYWVReWZzbnA0c0VLMTY0WTV3TkhKK0FBcGw2Z0hENExCOXBwMGlZcnNGMklNTVJqd0p1c3dUY1J1MTdMVFBzcXBYZEVwaE9RZHZyMDJ2UURvT3JYL2c4aWJoZHF2ZUsrQzlRZmMvdy9NdnJhWWluRVAxeXRuUUgwWDl3Mk1qRGVRPT0hdjE=?share_link_id=616425660275">this
          Miro board.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a slideshow (if you don't already have one) and place a link or
        PDF on the Miro board as well.
      </li>
    </ul>
    As your revisit the project, consider the implications of these two
    formats.
    <ul>
      <li>
        How is the 2D space of the Miro board different from from the linear
        progression of the slideshow?
      </li>
      <li>
        How does the virtual space of the Miro board differ from the physical
        space of the wall?
      </li>
    </ul>
    Prepare a brief (2-3 minute) personal introduction and overview of your
    project, including why you chose it for this project.
